Range: 120 feet
Components: V,S,M (a bit of phosphorous or wychwood, or a glowworm)

You create up to four torch-sized lights within range, making them appear as torches, lanterns or glowing orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely humanoid form of medium size. Whichever form you choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of another light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.

Light
Evocation Cantrip
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Components: V,M (a firefly or phosphoresecent moss)
Duration: 1 hour
You touch one object that is not larger than 10 feet in any dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely covering the object with something opaque blocks the light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it as an action. If you target an object worn or held by a hostile creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw to avoid the spell.
