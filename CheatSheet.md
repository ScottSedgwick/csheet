### Mounts
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

### Underwater Combat
If character has no swimming speed, then melee attacks have disadvantage unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, short sword, spear, or trident.

Ranged weapon attacks automatically miss beyond their normal range. Ranged weapon attacks are made with disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including spear, trident or dart).

Creatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage.
