    "That's why they gave me the gifts they did. When",
    "I was 5, they used their Luck Blade to wish me",
    "permanently polymorphed to an Enveloper, and",
    "then fed me a dead Doppelganger and a bunch of",
    "Yuan-Ti eggs. It made me able to blend in even",
    "better than they can, and I can absorb abiliies",
    "I need.",
    "The rest of my childhood was a blur of training.",
    "We joined a circus for most of my childhood to",
    "learn the skills they thought I would need.",
    "I'm an adventurer now, myself, so I suppose they",
    "were right. Still, sometimes I wonder what could",
    "have been."
