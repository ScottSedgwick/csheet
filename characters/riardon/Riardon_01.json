    "more.",
    "They were worried the curse would pass to me, but",
    "it didn't. I was born the same species as them.",
    "A Tiefling. So, much better.",
    "That's why they gave me the gifts they did. When",
    "I was 5, they used their Luck Blade to wish me",
    "permanently polymorphed to an Enveloper, and",
    "then fed me a dead Doppelganger and a bunch of",
    "Yuan-Ti eggs. It made me able to blend in even",
    "better than they can, and I can absorb abiliies",
    "I need.",
    "The rest of my childhood was a blur of training.",
    "We joined a circus for most of my childhood to",
    "learn the skills they thought I would need.",
    "I'm an adventurer now, myself, so I suppose they",
    "were right. Still, sometimes I wonder what could",
    "have been."
