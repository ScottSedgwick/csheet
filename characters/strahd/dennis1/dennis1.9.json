    "He has given up on finding out who he was.  Now he wanders the world, trying to help as much as he can, and do as little harm as he can manage.  ",
    "WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED: Dennis was a trainee knight in the Court of the Unseelie. He was originally a Monk of the Way of Open Hand. He grew up an orphan, poor and downtrodden, but was never caught by the city guard. ",
    "His ability to evade them became an embarrassment to the Court, and they sent a knight to capture Dennis. The knight was sufficiently impressed by the boy's skills that instead of punishing him, he sponsored his training.  "
