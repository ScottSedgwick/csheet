The target takes 3d6 *Poison* damage each turn. They can attempt to resist the poison at the end of their turn.

#### Widow's Kiss

Apply to weapons. The target takes 1d6 *Poison* damage and are considered *Infected*. If they resist the effect, they take half damage and are not considered *Infected*. They cannot save from this effect after failing, but once they save they cannot be affected again for 24 hours.

#### Good Times

***Nightmares:*** The target suffers horrible visions rendering them unable to discern reality from illusion. They view their allies as horrible monsters and their enemies are invisible to them (unless they have *Blindsight*, then they view them as monsters too). Their reaction depends on the humanoid that was poisoned. A *Paladin*, for example, might attack. A weak individual may run away as far as they can.

***Dreams:*** The target enters a state of bliss. They view everyone as extremely friendly. Hazardous environments may appear as swimming pools or beds. Their enemies have *Advantage* on any checks involving *Charisma* and the target has *Disadvantage* on any checks to resist *Persuasion* or *Deception*.
