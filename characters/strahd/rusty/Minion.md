***Evasion.*** If the homonculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it's incapacitated.

### Actions
***Force Strike.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* (your spell attack modifier) +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target you can see. *Hit* 1d4 + (PB) 3 force damage.

### Reactions
***Channel Magic.*** The homonculus delivers a spell you cast that has a range of touch. The homonculus must be within 120 feet of you.
