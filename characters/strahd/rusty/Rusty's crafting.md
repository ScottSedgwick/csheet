# Adamantine Armour

This suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you're wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.

# Bag of Bounty

This is a sturdy leather sack with tiny Siberys shards embedded into the lining. If you have the Mark of Hospitality you can use an action to cast Create Food and Water, drawing a feast from within the bag. You shape this meal with your thoughts. You can create the standard bland fare without requiring any sort of check, but you can attempt to create finer food by making a Charisma check; if you’re proficient with cook’s utensils, add your bonus to this check. A failed check results in a sour and squalid meal.

| Food Quality | Difficulty       |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| Poor         | No roll required |
| Modest       | 10               |
| Comfortable  | 13               |
| Wealthy      | 15               |
| Aristocratic | 18               |

A bag of bounty can be used up to three times over the course of a day. After that, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.

# Helm of Comprehending Languages

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the Comprehend Languages spell from it at will.

## Comprehend Languages 

For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in a text or glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn’t part of a written language.

# Lantern of Revealing

While lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern's bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.

# Saddle of the Cavalier

While in this saddle on a mount, you can't be dismounted against your will if you're conscious, and attack rolls against the mount have disadvantage.

# Winged Boots

While you wear these boots, you have a flying speed equal to your walking speed. You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration. If you are flying when the duration expires, you descend at a rate of 30 feet per round until you land.

The boots regain 2 hours of flying capability for every 12 hours they aren't in use.
