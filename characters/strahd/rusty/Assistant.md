***Evasion.*** If the homunculus is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails. It can't use this trait if it's incapacitated.

### Actions
***Craft.*** The homunculus assistant can make any crafting roll that it's creator can make.

***Magic Storing Item*** The homunculus assistant can cast any spell that has been cast into it, for the purpose of crafting only.

### Reactions
***Channel Magic.*** The homunculus delivers a spell you cast that has a range of touch. The homunculus must be within 120 feet of you.

### Restricted Existence

The homunculus assistant can only exist in a space sanctified to its creator.  This could be inside a demi-plane of the creator made, or inside an extra-dimensional space the creator made, or other area very closely affiliated with the creator.
