## Crafting non-magic items

* Need to be proficient with relevant tools.
* Work in area of speciality is twice as fast and half the cost.
* Determine crafting environment modifier.

For base item improvements, DC is based on the starting quality. The Artificer rolls their crafting (including modifiers above) and the items value is multiplied by the number of multiples of the DC was achieved.

So, a crude weapon has a base DC of 6. If the roll is 25, that is 4 times the DC.  If the original value was 5gp, the final value will be (5*4)gp or 20gp.
