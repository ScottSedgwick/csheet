  "backstory": [
    "Thomas has been driven - some say obsessed -",

    "wants to know how everything works right down to",
    "the level of fundamental particles (probably thaums,",
    "but he isn't certain of that). He believes everything",
    "is understandable, and ignorance is no shame, but",
    "a sign to investigate more deeply.",
    "As a result, he has little patience with people who",
    "engage in what he calls 'woo-woo thinking'.",
    "Warlocks and clerics, who gain power by sucking up",
    "to higher beings, are, in his opinion, taking",
    "unacceptable shortcuts which will come back to",
    "haunt them. Perversely, he doesn't extend this",
    "prejudice to people who don't practice magic at all -",
    "not being interested is fine by him, he's only irritated",
    "by people who do profess deeper knowledge, and",
    "then start spouting inane homilies masquerading as",
    "wisdom.",
    "This prejudice colours his relationship with his great",
    "aunt, Jenny Greentooth, who he loves, but regularly",
    "refers to as a blissed-out hippie tree-hugger.",
    "Thomas' secret desire is to know everything, and to",
    "that end, the one place he most wants to visit is the",
    "Library of All Knowledge. He has been a casual",
    "follower of Deneir ever since learning of its",
    "existence, and even changed his name to Thomas",

    "Gnomish values in him.  It hasn't worked.",
    "In his first real outing as an adventurer, Thomas",
    "allowed his excitement to get the better of him and it",
    "almost killed the entire party. He doesn't talk about it,",
    "but he is APPALLED that he let his emotions master",
    "his reason, and he is determined it will never happen",
