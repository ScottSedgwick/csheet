  "backstory": [
    "Bean was training to be a cleric of Moraddin in his home mine, but he never really fit in with the Dwarven lifestyle of carousing and fighting. When researching religious lore he had a vision that he claims was from the Dwarven Matriarch, Berronar Truesilver. She said that the chaotic ways of modern Dwarves was an aberration, and that the true nature of Dwarves was to be thoughtful and caring. Bean changed God immediately, and his clan (irritated that he now had a reason to be annoying) gave him the job of Guide to Visitors. Bean spent many years guiding visitors to the Dwarven lands through the wilderness, and it suited his demeanor to be a calming voice in the wilds. Having grown to an adult, Bean has passed his job to another youngster, and is travelling the lands, helping, bringing peace, and seeking purpose."
