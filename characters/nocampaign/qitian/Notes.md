Method for casting Wish
-----------------------

Create a simulacrum of myself.
Simulacrum cannot regain expended spell slots, but it **can** regain sorcery points.
Each LR retores it to 13 sorcery points.
Each SR regains 4 sorcery points (So a LR can restore 32 sorcery points)
The simulacrum can cast *Wish* as a psionic spell, at a cost of 9 sorcery points.
The simulacrum does all my *Wish* casting for me. 

As each simulacrum is created with at least 20 sorcery points and 1 9th level slot, it can cast 3 Wishes in quick succession, and will then need recycling, which takes 12 hours.
Therefore we can sustainably cast 6 Wishes per day.

Correction: Using Wish to cast Simulacrum does not create stress, and doesn't take 12 hours to cast, only one action. Qitian restores 39 sorcery points per short rest, so can sustainably cast 3 wishes per hour.
Each of those wishes creates a new Simulacrum, which casts (average) 3 wishes before being recycled. This means 9 wishes for converting 1 spell to psionic per hour, or 216 per day.
Therefore we can convert all our known spells (~500) in under 3 days.
